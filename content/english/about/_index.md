I never fit the script. While most people my age were busy checking boxes at school, I was busy breaking them — coding from the age of 4, pulling apart problems, and asking *why not?* Choosing **unschooling** was the turning point: it gave me permission to follow curiosity wherever it led, from building AI sign language translators to hacking together smart attendance systems. My method is simple: chase questions, not grades; prototype fast; and cut the BS by saying what will work and what won’t. I believe school isn’t the same as learning, being 16 is an advantage not a barrier, and innovation only matters when it breaks away from clones. If you’re here, you’re not looking for polished clichés — you’re here for raw ideas, experiments, and the mindset of someone building without limits.
