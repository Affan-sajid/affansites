honestly, writing everything down saved my sanity.

like, when you're going through major decision-making processes, your brain just becomes this swirling mess of considerations and what-ifs and second-guessing.

but when you force yourself to write it out - suddenly patterns emerge.

i have literally dozens of documents now tracking my thinking process from march to august. reading through them is wild because you can see the exact moment when certain realizations hit.

like there's this one doc where i'm trying to convince myself that the agency path makes sense, listing all these logical reasons. but you can feel the resistance in the writing. i'm trying SO hard to make it work on paper.

then there are other docs where the energy is completely different. i'm excited about building something, the words flow easily, i'm not fighting the logic - i'm following it.

writing forces you to be honest with yourself in a way that just thinking doesn't.

when it's just thoughts in your head, you can kind of ignore the contradictions. but when you write "i want to be recognized as an innovator" and then also write "90% of my time is spent on client work" - the disconnect becomes obvious.

plus, documenting the process helps you learn about your own decision-making patterns.

like, i now know that when i have to work really hard to convince myself something is a good idea, it probably isn't. and when something feels obviously right, it usually is.

also helps with the imposter syndrome stuff. when you have documented proof of your thinking process, it's harder to dismiss your decisions as "just got lucky" or "don't know what i'm doing."

anyway, if you're going through any major life decisions, write that stuff down. future you will thank you.
