yo, so let me take you back to 8th, 9th, 10th grade - i was ALWAYS trying to be different. while everyone else was doing the usual classroom stuff, i was building random projects, trying to innovate, basically being that weird kid who thinks they're gonna change the world.

problem was, i was pretty lonely. especially in 10th grade when my classes got shuffled and suddenly i didn't have anyone to talk to about this stuff. like, imagine trying to explain your startup ideas to classmates who are worried about biology homework.

but being lonely kinda made me more determined to be different, you know?

so after 10th grade, while everyone's asking "which +2 college?" i'm sitting there like... nah man, that path feels way too predictable. i'd been researching alternatives for ages - found out about open schooling and was like YES, this is it.

but then came the real question: okay cool, i'm not doing traditional +2... but what AM i gonna do for the next two years?

cue the most intense decision-making period of my life.

i literally wrote down every possible path i could think of. had these four main options that i kept going back and forth on for like a WHOLE MONTH. (yeah, i'll spare you the details but trust me, the analysis was intense)

then i discovered AI automation agencies.

the math seemed absolutely perfect:

- AI is literally everywhere rn
- businesses desperately need automation
- i understand tech way better than most adults
- boom, financial freedom by 18

plus, imagine the recognition - "yeah i'm 16 and i run an AI automation agency"

that would finally make people stop treating me like just another kid with unrealistic dreams, right?

the opportunity felt urgent too. like, how many 16-year-olds are thinking about this RIGHT NOW? if i didn't move fast, i'd miss the wave.

so after a month of analysis, spreadsheets, pros and cons lists - i was 100% convinced this was THE move.

spoiler alert: it wasn't.

but honestly? how was i supposed to know that at the time? on paper, everything looked flawless. sometimes the most logical decisions end up feeling completely wrong once you're actually living them.

so yeah, that decision led me down a path i thought would be perfect.

turns out, reality had other plans.
