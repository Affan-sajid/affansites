when i was mapping out this whole "skip +2 and build stuff" journey, i thought i had everything covered.

money? figured out a plan. family pressure? prepared my arguments. skill development? made a learning roadmap.

but there was one massive thing that blindsided me - the crave for connection.

## the downside i didn't see coming

here's what nobody warns you about when you choose an unconventional path: the loneliness hits different.

it's not just missing friends or social stuff. it's deeper than that.

it's waking up motivated about your projects but having nobody who really gets what you're building. it's solving a cool problem but having no one to share the excitement with who actually understands why it matters.

it's that constant background noise in your head asking "am i doing the right thing?" because you don't have anyone around you who can remind you why you started.

## what i thought vs what actually happened

i thought isolation would just mean more focus time. quiet space to work on projects without distractions.

what actually happened? my brain started having conversations with itself to fill the gap.

every decision became this huge internal debate. every small problem felt massive because i was trying to solve it completely alone.

all that mental energy that should have been going into building was getting burned up on overthinking and second-guessing.

## the real problem

when i was planning this period, i focused on the practical stuff - money, skills, family pushback.

i didn't think about the emotional and mental side. the part where humans are social creatures and we think better when we can bounce ideas off people who get it.

turns out, that's not optional. it's actually critical for doing good work.

the loneliness isn't just uncomfortable - it actively hurts the quality of what you're trying to build.

but now I understand the cause I am trying to find a solution . And i will inform as soon as i get something concrete

peace out ✌️
