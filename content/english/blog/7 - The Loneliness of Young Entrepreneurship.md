ngl this part hits different...

like, most of my friends are worried about which college to pick or what subjects to study, and i'm over here trying to figure out business models and product-market fit.

it gets isolating real quick.

you can't really vent to your friends about partnership equity concerns or decision paralysis about which project to focus on. they're not gonna relate to "should i prioritize revenue generation or innovation potential?"

and adults either treat you like you're playing pretend ("that's cute, kiddo") or they give you advice that doesn't really apply to your situation.

the online entrepreneur communities are mostly people in their 20s and 30s dealing with completely different challenges.

so you end up in this weird middle ground where you're too serious for your peer group but too young for the entrepreneur community.

honestly, writing these blogs is partly just me trying to document this experience because it feels so... specific? like, being 16 and trying to build something meaningful while everyone around you is following traditional paths.

sometimes i wonder if i'm just creating unnecessary pressure for myself. like, maybe i should just chill and enjoy being 16 instead of trying to change the world or whatever.

but then i remember that this isolation isn't permanent. every entrepreneur probably feels lonely at some point when they're working on something nobody else really understands yet.

and maybe there are other 16-year-olds out there going through similar stuff who could benefit from seeing that it's normal to feel confused and lonely and excited all at the same time.

plus, the loneliness pushes you to get really good at self-reflection and independent thinking. not the worst skills to develop early.

still lonely sometimes though. not gonna lie about that.
