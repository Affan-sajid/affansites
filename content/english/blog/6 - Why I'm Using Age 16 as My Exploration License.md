that whole messy decision-making process taught me something important about timing and opportunity.

like, when else in my life am i gonna have this much freedom to just... explore?

i literally have zero major responsibilities right now. no mortgage, no family depending on me, no career reputation to protect.

this is probably the ONLY time in my life where i can take completely irrational risks and explore weird ideas without major consequences.

like, if i spend the next 2 years building experimental projects and half of them fail - so what? i learned a ton and i'm still only 18.

if i spend the next 2 years "gaining business experience" and "understanding markets" - cool, but i could do that at 20 or 25 or 30 just as easily.

but this window of having zero constraints and maximum curiosity? that's not gonna last forever.

everyone's like "but you need to think about your future!"

bro, exploring freely IS thinking about my future. the skills and insights i get from building weird stuff at 16 are way more valuable than playing it safe.

plus, i can always make money later. financial freedom is cool but it's not going anywhere - the opportunities will still be there in a few years.

but the opportunity to think completely outside conventional frameworks? to build things without worrying about "market validation" and "business models"? that expires.

so yeah, this is my exploration license period. i'm gonna use it.

now, am i advising other people to do the same? nah. this is just my journey. maybe after going through all this, trying different approaches, failing at some stuff, succeeding at others - maybe then i'll have something useful to share.

right now i'm just a 16-year-old who decided to bet on curiosity over security.

so yeah, this is my exploration license period and i'm gonna use every bit of it.

but there's one thing nobody prepared me for about taking this unconventional path.
