If you had the chance to fly to the United States for free, spend time with other teenagers who love hacking, tinkering, and coding, would you take it?

For me, that so
unded like the kind of dream I’d imagine lying awake at night. And one day, out of nowhere, it landed right in front of me.

A friend called me and said there was this program where you could get selected to go to San Francisco. I asked him, _“What’s the catch?”_

He laughed and said, _“You just have to code for 100 hours. That’s it. They’ll track the hours. Finish it, and you’re in.”_

At first, I thought it was a joke. 100 hours? That sounded almost too easy. But then I realized this wasn’t just about coding. This was a door. An opportunity. And if I didn’t walk through it, I might regret it for the rest of my life.

So I started.

I needed an idea. Something that mattered. Something real.

That’s when it hit me: **public transport.**  
The one thing that frustrates me constantly.  
No bus timings, no clear routes, and always the pain of carrying loose change.

I decided to fix that. I was going to build a bus time finder app. And that night, I went to bed dreaming of flying to San Francisco with my project in hand.

## The Grind

The first few days were pure excitement. I mapped out users, flows, and problems. My first plan was a WhatsApp bot.

And then the first slap in the face: **planning didn’t count.**  
Brainstorming, sketching, system setup  none of it. Only coding hours.

I pushed forward anyway.

A few days later, I started coding. The bot worked  you could type in “from” and “to” and it would fetch coordinates. I felt like I was on track.

Then came slap number two: **bots weren’t allowed.** It had to be a standalone app.

I wanted to quit.

But I didn’t.

I switched to a web app. Backend? I was fine. Frontend? Not so much. So I leaned on GPT.

Big mistake.

The app worked, but it wasn’t mine. I didn’t understand it. Editing it felt impossible. I wasn’t building, I was just pasting code. And that scared me.

By the second week, I hit rock bottom. I had to learn React in just a couple of days to keep the project alive. I questioned everything  why I started, whether it was worth it, whether I should just walk away.

But somehow, I kept moving.  
I learned React. I used GPT carefully this time.  
And by the halfway mark, I finally had a working app.

I thought, _Tomorrow’s the day. Tomorrow I unlock my ticket to San Francisco._

## The Twist

And then it happened.

The program was canceled.

Just like that.

I can’t describe the feeling. It was disappointment, frustration, and… weirdly, a little relief. The late nights, the endless hours, the constant stress  it was over in an instant.

## The Lessons

Looking back, I realize I learned more in those hours than I expected:

- Understand the requirements before you start  don’t dive in blind.
    
- Dreaming is easy. Working is hard. Really hard.
    
- Don’t pin all your hopes on one opportunity. It might disappear overnight.
    
- AI is a tool, not a replacement. If you let it think for you, you stop thinking.
    

So no, I didn’t end up in San Francisco. Not yet.  
But this isn’t the end.

My bus project isn’t dead  just on pause. It’ll come back stronger. And so will I.

Because this wasn’t really about a program. It was about proving to myself that I could chase something scary, messy, uncertain  and survive it.

And bigger things are coming.

Until next time,  
**Peace out ✌️**
