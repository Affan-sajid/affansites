so for the longest time, my measure of success was external validation.

"16-year-old entrepreneur" sounded so cool. like, imagine walking into a room and that's how people introduce you.

but here's what actually happened when i got that title - it felt empty.

because at the end of the day, when you're alone with your work, titles don't matter. what matters is whether you're proud of what you're actually building.

and i realized i wasn't proud of saying "i run an agency." i wanted to be proud of saying "i built this thing that helps people do X."

the story you tell yourself about your work matters more than the story other people tell about you.

like, external recognition is cool for a minute, but you have to live with your work every single day. if that work doesn't align with who you actually are, all the recognition in the world won't make it feel meaningful.

i think this is especially weird for young entrepreneurs because everyone's so focused on the age angle. "wow, so young, so impressive!"

but after a while, you realize - okay cool, people think it's impressive that i'm young. but am i actually impressed with the work itself?

that's a much harder question to answer.

now i'm trying to optimize for a different kind of story. not "impressive young entrepreneur" but "person who builds solutions to problems they actually care about."

way less flashy. way more sustainable.

the recognition will come naturally if the work is good. but the work has to come first.
