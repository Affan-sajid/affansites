Hi, Affan here. I don't know if anyone is listening or reading in this case. but I'm writing for you so hear me out 

hello, my name is Affan and i am a 16 year old who decided not to go to school this  yeah it might sound stupid, but bear with me. I live in a small village in India and I always wanted to Achieve more and be something different. and that inspired me to do this. not only that but in high school ( for someone outside India, in here high school is 8th 9th and 10th grade) I was more outside the class and than in class studying . in labs, staff rooms, competitions and in principal's cabin not because I was a naughty kid. it was because I was more interested in those things than what happened in class rooms and I still managed to get good mark. so no one had any complaints. I was the school leader, started a student council in my school , I was in the first batch of innovation lab also helping building and designing the whole thing and in science fairs , art fairs and every extra curricular thing that I could possibly do. 

let me give you some background, started coding at grade 4. it was then I found my pure love for computers, and and at the age of 12, i started building some cool Ai projects with python . and I also did some projects to including dog repeller project, sign language translator and stuff like that.

so  it was these things that inspired me to try something different this year and get out from traditional schools. and  build your own syllabus thing 

I don't know if this all works out or if it will fail miserably. but neither I'm moving forward and I wanna do a lot of innovation build things and i am working on a startup right now.  I don't wanna stop my learning. I learn through building, meeting and also through the real market. also I didn't completely drop the traditional method i still do 11th grade through online 

so in here i will share my journey and some of my crazy stories that i had previously in my life 

I don't know in what format I would upload contents here, daily diary type or topic type or maybe stories . but i do wanna continue this. 


so until next time. peace out ✌️
