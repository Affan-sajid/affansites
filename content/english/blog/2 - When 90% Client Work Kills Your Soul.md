okay so fast forward 3 months into the agency life...

remember that excitement i had? that "main character energy"?

yeah, that died real quick.

here's what they don't tell you about running a service business - you become a full-time problem solver for OTHER people's problems. and not the cool, innovative kind of problem solving. nah, it's like "hey can you make this automation work with our weird legacy system that was built in 2015?"

the time breakdown was brutal:

- 90% of my time: adapting solutions for client needs
- 10% of my time: actually building something cool



i remember this one moment where someone asked me "so what do you do?" and i started saying "i run an AI automation agency" but honestly? that answer felt so... empty.

like, what i WANTED to say was "i built this sick solution that helps people do X" or "i created this thing that solves Y problem." but instead i'm out here sounding like every other agency owner.

the worst part? i kept optimizing for the client's needs instead of actually innovating. it's like being a really good waiter when you actually want to be a chef, if that makes sense.

don't get me wrong - the partnership was solid, learned a ton, made some money. but every morning i'd wake up thinking about the hardware projects i wasn't building, the innovative solutions i wasn't creating.

it hit me that i was basically cosplaying as an entrepreneur while doing consultant work.

and that's when the real confusion started...
