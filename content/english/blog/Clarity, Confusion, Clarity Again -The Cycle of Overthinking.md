so you'd think after all that analysis and framework-building, i'd have this bulletproof confidence in my decisions, right?

wrong. so very wrong.

_spends 2 weeks analyzing everything_ "YES. i have COMPLETE clarity. this is obviously the right move."

_2 hours later_ "wait... am i making a huge mistake? what if i'm wrong about everything?"

_1 month later_ "actually let me reconsider this entire thing from scratch"

and then the cycle repeats.

i used to think this meant i was bad at making decisions or overthinking too much. like maybe if i just planned better or analyzed more thoroughly, i'd reach some perfect state of certainty.

but here's what i figured out - that's not how it works.

the confusion isn't a bug, it's a feature. your brain is literally processing new information and updating its models. of course you're gonna question previous decisions when you learn new stuff.

the problem isn't the confusion - it's thinking that you need to find the "perfect" decision.

there is no perfect decision. there's just doing something that YOU actually want to do.

like, all my analysis and frameworks and decision matrices... they're useful, but at the end of the day, the question isn't "what's the optimal path?"

it's "what do i actually want to spend my time on?"

and for me, that answer keeps coming back to building things. creating solutions. not optimizing other people's businesses.

so yeah, i still get confused. i still second-guess myself. but now i know that's normal and i don't need to solve it - i just need to keep moving in the direction that feels right.

the clarity will come and go. the confusion will come and go. but as long as i'm doing something that aligns with who i am, the rest is just noise.

but here's the thing - once you stop fighting the confusion and just accept it as part of the process, you can focus on what actually matters.

and for me, that meant using this chaotic time in my life as an advantage.
